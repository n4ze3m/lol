# Lol Message

Open source anonymous feedback and advice platform for anyone lol.

## Inspiration

Lol Message is inspired from the popular website NGL.link. I really liked the idea of anonymous feedback and advice platform and    wanted to build something similar for myself.
So I decided to build a similar platform for myself and for others to use for free and open source.

## What it does

Similar NGL.link, You will get a link to share with your friends and family. Anyone who visits the link can send you a message. You can reply to the messages that you recevied via any social media platform installed on your phone.

## How we built it

I built this app using Next.js, Mantine UI, tRPC, Courier for Email Notifications, Supabase and Vercel for hosting

## Challenges we ran into

I had never used tRPC and Courier before. So I had to learn them from scratch. After learning them, I had to integrate them with my app. It was a bit challenging but I managed to do it.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

I am proud of the fact that I was able to build this app in such a short time. I am also proud of the fact that I was able to learn tRPC and Courier from scratch and integrate them with my app.

## What we learned

I learned how to use tRPC and Courier notifications.

## What's next for Lol Message

Mobile app with push notifications and more features.
